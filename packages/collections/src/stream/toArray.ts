/**
 * Converts a given readable stream into an array.
 *
 * __IMPORTANT NOTE:__ Streams are designed to manage backpressure, which means
 * they control the flow of data so that the data source does not overwhelm the
 * consumer. This helps in efficiently using compute resources. By converting
 * the stream into an array, we lose the ability to manage backpressure because
 * we gather data as fast as it is buffered, not as fast as it is processed.
 * Generally, it's better to use `WritableStream` or `TransformStream` to handle
 * `ReadableStream` data. This function is mostly useful for testing purposes
 * rather than in production.
 *
 * @param stream - The stream to drain into an array.
 *
 * @returns An array containing the streamed data.
