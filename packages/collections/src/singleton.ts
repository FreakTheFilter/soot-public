/**
 * A singleton is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of
 * a class to a singular instance. This file contains helpers for managing
 * singletons in JS.
 *
 * A note on one _very_ common use for lazily-evaluated singletons: We used to
 * initialize a LOT of caches like this in global scope in api-v2 and proxy.
 * This made data lifecycles hard to trace because caches would initialize not
 * when the server started, but then node imported the file. To make matters
 * worse, if a cache had a failure state during initialization we had no way to
 * exit the server safely. Just had to process.exit(1). However by using lazily
 * evaluated singletons we now have a way to carefully control when singletons
 * are initialized and handle errors from that initialization. We can ensure
 * that data is only initialized the first time it is used and that callsites
 * handle errors from that initialization.

 * Example Usage:

 * ```
 *
 * Note that the singleton will be lazily constructed on the first call to the
 * getter.
 *
 * @param factory The factory which constructs the singleton.
 * @param options Additional optional parameters. See properties for details.
 * @param options.lazy When true, the singleton wont be constructed until the

 *
 * @returns A getter to retrieve the singleton.
